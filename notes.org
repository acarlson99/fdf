* Data progression
Read in data
Make array of vectors
Project 3D image onto 2D canvas
Points are now in screen space
Coords not in the range 0,1 are Normalized Device Coordinates
Normalize coordinates by remaping then to range [0,1]
Convert to raster space by multiplying all NDC coords by image dimension
